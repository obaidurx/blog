      `At one time I had a very favorite line -

      "I'll tell you, that forgotten story, knocked on the wrong door."
      
      I'm not sure why the man was bored at the wrong door. Yet every time I heard the line I sank into a deep depression.
      
      My old severe headache has taken hold again today. Random words are running away. Back and forth Here and there. You have to sew one by one by force. The house is dark and the laptop is cluttered. Eye strain. Very! The headache is getting worse. Baruk. Growing up, I would become obsessed for a while, at that time I would start to feel like I was intoxicated. Nothing else is felt.
      
      What am I saying? Oh yes…
      wrong door, knock… ..
      
      Making mistakes is one of the most important tasks of the human race. This series of us started from Baba Adam (AS).
      
      In this one life I have made mistakes many, many times. I knocked on the wrong door one by one.
      
      People learn from mistakes. I am a boy of Matbar class. I also learned. I have learned that there is no love in this world for people. All love, all feelings, all compassion should be reserved for the one and only Creator. It frees you from the waste of such love. In the same way, you are liberated from the pain of breaking your heart and being deceived.
      
      Our Creator will never laugh at our helplessness.
      
      People laugh at people's helplessness. Very! It is also one of the most beloved works of man. Someone stumbled and fell - we laughed. Because I am standing, safe, healthy.
      
      I can't find any meaning in my writing. I forgot what I was writing. The yarn has been cut repeatedly. Spelling and grammar mistakes are probably a lot today. Grammar cops will play armpits. Bajak!

      `Case study 1:
      The death occurred in a car accident. Numerous glasses had penetrated the body of the deceased. Hundreds, or thousands? He could not be touched. What to do? After much thought an intellect came out. I don't remember how, but the corpse was half-lying down and water started pouring from the opposite direction with great speed through the water pipe. Something like watering a tree. From a distance, it was noticed that no one was in front. Innumerable glasses of that water came out of the body. After doing this several times, the situation became at least so much that the body was being touched, somehow the bath was done and the shroud was put on.
      
      Case Study 2:
      
      The girl came out of the house wearing the latest fashion tight jeans and tops. What has been bought a little too tight? Nah, as much as it sticks to the skin, the body shape is well understood, it also looks beautiful - the girl was thinking while sitting in the rickshaw. But it was stopped by a bus speeding from the opposite direction. He fell from the rickshaw. While taking a bath, it was seen that the jeans of such a simple person were sitting on the body in such a way that nothing could be removed from the body. What to do then? With great difficulty the scissors were cut from the ankles. In order not to cut the flesh of the body, the jeans were carefully removed from the body and a bath was given.
      
      Case Study 3 6
      
      "I'm so scared, Ray," the girl whispered to her sister as she walked to the doctor. If it is a girl this time, your brother-in-law has told you not to hit the door of his house.
      
      Ah apa, don't think so much, Allah is the owner of sustenance. You don't have to go to that house with girl number three.
      
      Seven or five did not think so and comforted the elder sister. But did he understand what he said to his sister?
      
      This time the girl was seen in the ultra sonogram. Thinking about what to say to her husband when she returned home, the girl stumbled down the stairs to the doctor's chambers. When it rolled down a few steps, it was all over. The girl, wrapped in a burqa from head to toe, walked gracefully to her rabbi, along with the girl in her womb. And the 'huge' crime of giving birth to a girl is no longer punishable. The girl who had the experience of taking a bath said that very few baths have been completed in such a simple and beautiful way. There was a light smile on his face. He did not have to return home in disgrace, he returned to a respectable house.
